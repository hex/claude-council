# Council Query Execution

## Step 1: Run Query and Save to File

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-council.sh --providers=gemini,openai "Your question"
```

This outputs the path to the saved file (e.g., `.claude/council-cache/council-1734567890.md`).

**Flag syntax**: Use `=` with no spaces: `--providers=gemini,openai`

## Step 2: Read and Display the Output VERBATIM

Use the **Read tool** to read the output file path returned by Step 1.

**CRITICAL**: Display the file content EXACTLY as written. Do NOT:
- Reformat or reinterpret any text
- Add your own headers or structure
- Summarize or abbreviate responses
- Skip any lines including separator lines (`---`)

Simply copy-paste the entire file content into your response.

## Step 3: Complete the Synthesis Section

The file ends with a `## Synthesis` header. Write your synthesis UNDER that header:
- **Consensus**: Where providers agree
- **Divergence**: Where they disagree
- **Recommendation**: Best approach

## Step 4: Notify User of Saved Output

After displaying the synthesis, tell the user:

> ---
> (use this emoji 💾) Full output saved to `.claude/council-cache/council-TIMESTAMP.md` (use the actual filename)

This lets them review the complete responses later.

## Provider Names

**ALWAYS use emoji when mentioning a provider:**
- 🔵 Gemini
- ⚪ OpenAI
- 🔴 Grok
- 🟢 Perplexity
